            <h3>Support and advice to start your own business</h3>
            <p>Virgin is entrepreneurial at its heart, having spent the last 50 years starting<br>
                 and scaling businesses around the world. In 2013, Virgin StartUp was<br>
                 founded by Richard Branson to support the next generation of founders<br>
                 who are looking to do the same.</p>
            <p>As a not-for-profit, we work to empower founders to not only start-up and<br>
                survive, but thrive. By providing business advice, access to funding,<br>
                mentoring and a growing community, we’re helping thousands of founders<br>
                to change business for good.</p>
            <img src="Virgin-StartUp_Image_02.png" alt="">
            <p>Businesses funded by Virgin StartUp survive longer, generate higher<br>
                turnover and hire more people than businesses supported by other start-up<br>
                support organisations in the UK. We have an unrelenting focus on the<br>
                founders that we exist to support and look to use the platform and network<br>
                we have, to help them thrive.</p>
            <p>Currently only one in five start-ups in the UK has a woman founder – we<br>
                think that’s something that needs to change. In 2019 we became the first<br>
                start-up support organisation to pledge equal funding for men and women<br>
                with our 50:50 <a href="">pledge</a>.</p>
            <img src="Virgin-StartUp_Image_08.png" alt="">
            <p>We passionately believe in entrepreneurship and want to support any<br>
                founder who has an ambition to start and scale an early stage business. One<br>
                that adds value to them, to their community and to the economy more<br>
                broadly. We’re open to working with founders across any industry, whether<br>
                they’re looking to start a lifestyle business or have ambitions for a high<br>
                growth venture.</p>
